TRANSITION PROBABILITY VECTORS (WORD VECTORS)
======================================================================

Each nucleotide has a probability vector for transitioning to the next:

Nucleotide 'A' transition vector:
  Vector: [A:0.3333, T:0.2778, C:0.1667, G:0.2222]
  Sum: 1.000000

Nucleotide 'T' transition vector:
  Vector: [A:0.3077, T:0.3077, C:0.1538, G:0.2308]
  Sum: 1.000000

Nucleotide 'C' transition vector:
  Vector: [A:0.3636, T:0.2727, C:0.3636, G:0.0000]
  Sum: 1.000000

Nucleotide 'G' transition vector:
  Vector: [A:0.5714, T:0.1429, C:0.2857, G:0.0000]
  Sum: 1.000000
